          What is Document Object Model(DOM)?
        </div>

          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
            documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
            document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
            document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
            interact with the page.

          How do you select an-element from the DOM?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Got to grips with how the DOM is structured—it's like a tree with
            nodes, and every element in your HTML is a part of this data
            structure. Dived into using .getElementById() to select elements by
            their unique ID, which is a straight shot to identifying specific
            elements. Discovered the power of .querySelector() for using CSS
            selectors to find elements, which is incredibly versatile as it can
            select any CSS query. Explored .querySelectorAll() to fetch an
            array-like collection of nodes, allowing you to work with multiple
            elements that match your query. Touched upon the difference between
            HTMLCollection and NodeList—the former is live and updates with the
            DOM, while the latter is static.

          What is Event Delegation in the context of the DOM,and why is useful?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Event delegation is a design pattern in JavaScript used to
            efficiently manage and handle events on multiple child elements by
            attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor element.
